# ⌨️ Keyboard & Streaming Features

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 🎯 Streaming Responses
Your AI chat now has **full streaming support** - responses appear word-by-word like ChatGPT!

**How it works:**
1. User sends message
2. Connects to DeepSeek API with `stream: true`
3. Receives chunks in real-time
4. Updates UI word-by-word
5. Shows blinking cursor while streaming

**Visual feedback:**
- Typing dots while waiting: `● ● ●`
- Streaming text with cursor: `Hello there!|`
- Final message: `Hello there!`

### ⌨️ Keyboard Controls

**Desktop:**
- `Enter` → Send message
- `Shift + Enter` → New line (if you want multi-line)
- `ESC` → Focus out of input

**Mobile:**
- Tap "Send" button on keyboard (shows as "Send" icon)
- `enterKeyHint="send"` optimizes mobile keyboard

**Input Features:**
- ✅ Auto-focus on chat open
- ✅ Clears after sending
- ✅ Disabled while loading
- ✅ Prevents empty messages
- ✅ No auto-correct (better for tech questions)
- ✅ No auto-complete (cleaner experience)
- ✅ 16px font size (prevents iOS zoom)
- ✅ ARIA labels for accessibility

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Streaming Implementation:
```typescript
// In useAIChat.ts
stream: true,  // Enable streaming

// Process chunks
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  // Decode and display each chunk
  setStreamingMessage(accumulatedContent);
}
```

### Keyboard Handler:
```typescript
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter" && !e.shiftKey) {
    e.preventDefault();
    handleSend();
  }
};
```

### Input Attributes:
```tsx
<Input
  onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
  enterKeyHint="send"      // Mobile optimization
  autoComplete="off"        // No suggestions
  autoCorrect="off"         // No corrections
  autoCapitalize="sentences" // Natural capitalization
