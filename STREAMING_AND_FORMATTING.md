# ✨ Streaming & Auto-Scroll Improvements

## 🎯 What Was Improved

### 1. **Smooth Auto-Scroll** ✅
- Changed from instant scroll to smooth scroll animation
- Automatically scrolls as content streams in
- Uses `scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' })` for better UX

**How it works:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (scrollRef.current) {
    scrollRef.current.scrollTo({
      top: scrollRef.current.scrollHeight,
      behavior: 'smooth'  // Smooth scrolling!
    });
  }
}, [messages, streamingMessage]);
```

**Result:** Chat smoothly scrolls down as AI responds, keeping latest content visible.

### 2. **Markdown Formatting** ✨
AI responses now support rich formatting!

**Supported formats:**
- **Bold text:** `**bold**` → **bold**
- *Italic text:* `*italic*` → *italic*
- `Code snippets:` `` `code` `` → `code`
- Bullet lists
- Numbered lists
- Paragraphs with proper spacing

**Installed:** `react-markdown` package

**Custom styling:**
- Bold text highlighted in primary color
- Code with background and padding
- Lists with proper spacing
- Paragraphs with margin

---

### 3. **Streaming with Formatting** 🎬

**While streaming:**
- Text appears word-by-word with markdown parsing
- Blinking cursor shows it's still typing: `|`
- Smooth scroll follows the growing content
- Formatting applied in real-time

**Final result:**
- Full message with all formatting
- Clean, readable output
- Professional appearance
